1. IsolateSelected_MEL:
Isolate Selected for Maya - A script that allows you to toggle isolate (hide) your selection in object or component mode.
As inspiration I have used the functionality from 3ds Max.

Originally I wrote this simple script as part of a whole set, in order to accomodate a team of Max users to get used to working with Maya and add some missing funcionality
